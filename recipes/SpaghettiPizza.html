        <h2>How to make Spaghetti Pizza Step-by-step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>Mix 1/2 cup mozzarella, milk, egg, salt, and garlic salt together in a large bowl. Add drained spaghetti and mix until well combined. Spread mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spread spaghetti sauce over noodle mixture. Sprinkle with oregano and basil, then top with remaining 1 1/2 cups mozzarella. Arrange pepperoni over cheese.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven and bake until cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, about 30 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before cutting.</li>
        </ol>
